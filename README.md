## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on API Keys

During the video, an example **Porkbun API key and secret** is shown for demonstration purposes.  
**This key was immediately revoked after recording** and cannot be used for any access.  
Always be cautious when handling API credentials and revoke any keys shown in public demos.
